        <h2>EXPERIENCE THE BEST COFFEE IN TOWN!</h2>
        <p>
          Coffee is not just a drink that was prepared by someone. Coffee is a
          moment, and we will show you that. Phrases like "How about we have a
          coffee?" or "Let's make some coffee?" are demonstrations that one of
          the moments that most reinforce bonds with others is finally about to
          happen. Weak or strong? With or without sugar? Do you want sugar or
          sweetener? These are phrases we hear in various places. In almost
          every place where there are people, there is also coffee. We seem
          intrinsic to coffee. Here at Manhattan, we will serve you with much
          care our beloved Amaro's Coffee directly from our coffee plantation in
          Minas Gerais. For all of us, coffee is serious business and deserves
          all the care.

        <h2>WHAT IS MANHATTAN COFFEE?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the Specialty Coffee Association's (SCA) Sensory
          Evaluation Methodology, used worldwide, a specialty coffee is one that
          scores at least 80 points on the methodology's scoring scale (which
          goes up to 100). Manhattan Coffee stands out in the attributes of
          fragrance, body, harmony, sweetness, and flavor, in this case, having
          flavors and aromas that can be fruity, herbal, sweet like caramel and
          chocolate. We can make an analogy with wine because Manhattan Coffee
          can also be appreciated for its sensory characteristics and not just
          for the caffeine. Through excellent cultivation standards,
          post-harvest care, and roasting, you will be able to experience
          different and delicious types of coffee.

        <h2>GET TO KNOW GOURMET MANHATTAN COFFEE?</h2>
        <p>
          The characteristics of this type of gourmet coffee from Manhattan are
          very striking. Its body will depend on the blend variety: the heavier
          it is in the mouth, the greater the body. The lighter its weight, the
          lower the body. Our gourmet coffee is the best evaluated in the
          production process, so that it does not come with any type of defect.
          The aroma is very noticeable, and the consumer can clearly feel it,
          and it can vary among 4 aromas: floral, citrus, chocolatey, fruity.
          These variations are consequences of Arabica beans. All of this will
          depend on the roasting, the lighter it is, the higher the acidity.
